Algol 60 -> BCPL (mid-60s) -> B (late-60s) -> NB/C (Early 70s)
- B was made by Dennis Ritchie to help with UNIX development. B wasnt robust enough for all of UNIX, so Ritchie extended it more until it became NB (New B) and then renamed to C.
- C allowed the entirety of UNIX to be written in it and by making C compilers for their various systems, they got UNIX on other computers at Bell Labs
- First C "standard" was the K&R "The C Programming Language" in 1978
- First comprehensive C standard was ANSI 1989/ISO 9899:1990/C89/C90
- Some ammendments in 1995 and other additions added for ISO 9899:1999/C99
